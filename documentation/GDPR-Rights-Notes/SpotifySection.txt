Spotify GDPR Section

In response to privacy concerns about online data, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in the European Union in May 2018.
The GDPR grants users different rights in regards to the personal data online services collect about them.
For example, it grants the right for you to access your personal data that the company has collected. 
We have compiled instructions on how you can obtain such a data-download for some examplary service on our Services Page that you have already visited.
It also grants the right to data portability. This means that you should be able to take your data and upload it to a competing service or company. 
Additionally, you have the right to erase your data if the legal basis on which the data was collected - for example your consent to the collection - is not given anymore, 
and you also have the right to rectify your data, meaning to correct false information that a company has about yourself.
