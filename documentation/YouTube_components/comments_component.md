YouTube Comment Component

Description

The YouTubeCommentComponent serves as an interface for YouTube content creators and viewers to track and analyze their comment activity on the platform. 

It provides two modes of operation: a preview mode for quick summaries and a detailed mode for more in-depth exploration of comment data.

Features:

Preview Mode: Quickly view the total number of comments made.

Detailed Mode: Dive deeper into specific comments, their timestamps, and associated videos. This mode also includes visual analytics representing the trend of comment activity over time.
Usage

Preview Mode:

Shows the total number of comments with a simplistic icon representation.

Useful for a quick glance at user engagement without entering the full application details.

Detailed Mode:

Offers a comprehensive view of all comments posted by the user, organized by date and linked directly to the commented video on YouTube.

Includes a tabbed interface that separates general comment analytics from specific lists of comments.

Utilizes ECharts to provide graphical representations of comment activity trends.

Component Integration:

Add the YouTubeCommentComponent to any module by declaring it in the module's declarations array.

Ensure all dependencies, particularly NgZorro for Angular components and ECharts for visualization, are properly installed and imported into your project.
