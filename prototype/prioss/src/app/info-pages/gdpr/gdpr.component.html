    <p>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union's (EU) data protection law effective from May 2018. 
      It is applicable for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA). 
      It was created to regulate the collection, processing, and storage of personal data by any corporation in the world, 
      as long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU.
      The GDPR also defines a range of individual rights you have in regards to your personal data.
