    <li><b>Right to Access:</b> Individuals have the right to access their personal data that has been collected and stored by companies.</li>
    <li><b>Right to be Forgotten:</b> Individuals have the right to request the deletion of their personal data.</li>
    <li><b>Data Portability:</b> Individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a format that is easily transferable to another organization.</li>
    <li><b>Data Protection Officers (DPOs):</b> Companies that process large amounts of personal data or sensitive personal data must appoint a DPO.</li>
