  <p nz-typography>You have created an Instagram account and you want followers. So, you start following even unknown people that you discover. In return, some of them follow you back. However, after a while, you may start to receive inappropriate comments on your photos from those users. Or on the contrary, they may not interact with your posts in any way and you feel that they are only lurking.</p>

  <p nz-typography>Even if you have turned on the option to make your photos private, <strong>it won’t keep your posts private from those who are already following you</strong>. In this case, you will have to manually remove <strong>(Block)</strong> the people you don’t want to see your photos.</p>

  <p nz-typography>To remove followers from your list, follow these steps:</p>
